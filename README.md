It is an E-Commerce website project. Creating an E-Commerce site is one of the challenging tasks. During the trajectory of this project get a lot of challenges, and at last, the project is ready. In this project, I have created a shop that has a lot of features like has category bar where we can get products of the same category. Then it has added to the Cart section where we add a product to the cart. And finally, it has a Payment gateway through which we can place an order and pay the amount of the product.
